        Hello Kitty Grand Cafe offers a supercute menu featuring freshly baked cookies, cakes, donuts, seasonal goodies,
        and handmade hot and iced drinks, along with a selection of Hello Kitty Cafe merchandise and a sweet seating
        area to enjoy the experience. Stop by and say hello!
        This Hello Kitty-themed Grand Cafe is a temple of pink-hued cuteness and they have new lemony treats on the
        menu.
        Sanrio lovers, this one’s for you! The world’s most recognized cartoon cat was translated into a heavenly foodie
        experience at the Irvine Spectrum Center in 2018. Featuring not one, but two spaces – with three different
        themes. One side is the Hello Kitty Grand Cafe, a relaxed casual spot that offers made-to-order donuts, Sanrio
        character mini cakes, and lattes with beloved Ms. Kitty’s face printed on the foam.
        The opposite side, <span> The Bow Room at Hello Kitty Grand Cafe </span>, is probably where you’ll be spending
        most of your
        time. High tea is served during daylight hours and once the clock strikes 5 pm the pink palace turns into a 21+
        cocktail lounge. Whether you plan on sipping tea with Hello Kitty-shaped sugars or cocktails like the Matcha
        Matcha which includes Japanese whiskey.

        If you’re looking for a girl’s night that will transport you back to your childhood, we’ve found the perfect
        spot. Afternoon tea service can be reserved on Fridays from 11 am until 2:30 pm, and weekends from 10 am to 3:30
        pm. Cocktail service at the Bow Room can be reserved Fridays and Saturdays from 5 pm to 9:30 pm.
